# Deeplearning-in-Mnist
Here deep learning algorithm is applied on MNIST dataset for image classification.
# MNIST Dataset
The dataset consists of 70000 images, 60000 images are taken as traning set remaining 10000 images as testing set. All the images are 28*28 with 10 classes (0-9).
# Libraries
* tensorflow
* keras
* matplotlib
# Activation function
* relu
* softmax

# Optimizer

# Summary
Here the CNN alogorithm evaluated with different filter values, optimizers. The CNN with specified parameteres, optimizers are effectively increases the accuracy of the model.
